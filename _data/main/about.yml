   Welcome to the Advanced Computational Mechanics and Materials Laboratory (ACMML) in the Department of Mechanical Engineering at University of Rochester. 

   In our lab we integrate our knowledge of physics, solid mechanics, materials science, computational multiscale modeling,  and experimentation to improve the understanding of the physics of the deformation of advanced materials and develop mathematical models to predict the mechanical or physical properties of such materials.
