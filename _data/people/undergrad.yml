  project: Deformation behaviors of nanoporous materials
  project_desc: "Phase transformation mechanisms in metallic nanoparticles."
  personal_desc: "I’m currently an undergraduate student majoring in Mechanical engineering here at the University of Rochester. I’m from Pakistan, though I was born and raised in Muscat, Oman. I joined the lab in the summer of 2017, after my sophomore year, because I am very interested in nanomaterials research, and how I can implement it into SWARM robotics, one of my other passions, in the future. I am currently working with Lijie on the modelling and analysis of 3D random nanoporous materials. 
I really enjoy writing, and I can never say no to a good iced latte out on the Eastman quad on a good summer day!"
